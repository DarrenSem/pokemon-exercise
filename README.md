Trying the example "Pokedex Problem" that Theo (of Ping.gg) says he gives candidates for Junior React Developer role.
(To more easily confirm somebody "knows their stuff" in React, rather than typical algorithm-memorization technical interviews.)
###### LATER retried using JSX and Vite (config to make build work properly was *quite a challenge*) @ https://github.com/DarrenSem/pokemon-exercise-vite

"Rethinking the Technical Interview"
Theo - t3â€¤gg
May 15, 2023

# TODO:
- get it work locally, without using build tools or even JSX -- just including React/ReactDOM .js from unpkg.com (also try Preact as a test)
- later start from scratch using proper build tools (and import/export, and JSX), like every web dev shop actually uses every day
